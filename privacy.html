    <p>
      Our policy is that
      <strong>you can trust Monoidentity because you don't have to</strong>. There aren't any blind
      boxes you need to put your faith in.
    </p>

    <h2>A private baseline</h2>
    <p>
      An app that uses Monoidentity is private by default, with anything you enter in
      <code>monoidentity.web.app</code> being transferred directly to the app, and anything you do
      in the app staying entirely local. You can read
      <a href="https://github.com/KTibow/monoidentity">our code</a> to verify this.
    </p>

    <h2>The verification primitive</h2>
    <p>
      If an app wants to verify you, we have a simple method for this: connect
      <strong>directly</strong> to StudentVue to exchange your password for a token. That
      <strong>token</strong> goes to our server to verify you're who you say you are (and if
      successful, generating a JWT). We don't store the input, details, or output of this process.
    </p>

    <h2>The cloud primitive</h2>
    <p>
      Any user can opt to get verified and get sponsored with a cloud storage bucket hosted on R2.
      Data that is synced - chosen by apps, and excluding personal data like passwords and caches -
      isn't end to end encrypted, but our policy is that it's a. sent over HTTPS and sent directly
      b. encrypted at rest c. for you only (but that goes without saying).
    </p>

    <h2>No tracking</h2>
    <p>No tracking cookies, no ads, no analytics.</p>
